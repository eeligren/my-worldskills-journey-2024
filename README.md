Here is a list of some of the projects I have completed during this journey.

**All of them were made without access to the internet or any generative AI.**

## Online multiplayer drawing game

- **From**: UWDC2024
- **Time**: 7h

Description: In UWDC2024, your task is to build a collaborative drawing game designed to offer a fun and engaging experience. Players can choose between two game modes: Freehand, where they draw based on a random word with 8-second turns, and Tracing, where they replicate a random SVG image as accurately as possible. You are also responsible for building the landing page UI, ensuring it matches the provided design and style guidelines consistently across all pages.

## Virtual office

- **From:** UWDC2023
- **Time:** 6h

**Description:** After the pandemic, many companies adopted remote work, but employees felt isolated. To address this, XOXO is developing a virtual office. Your task is to create an MVP for a virtual office web application that shows employees' avatars in real-time. The theme is based on The Office TV show. You will be provided with a pre-defined office layout as a background, and your task is to add selectable areas where users can be assigned. The application must update this information in real-time using WebSockets or AJAX.

Users can:
- Start and end session.
- See session length.
- Choose and change avatar from predefined avatars.
- See a real-time list of all rooms/zones and participants in each room/zone.
- See the virtual office layout with the logged-in users' avatars.
- Enter and leave rooms/zones.
- Chat with people in the same room.

## Concert ticket system

## Easing functions visual simulator

- **From:** EuroSkills 2018
- **Time:** 6.5h

**Description:** The project involves creating a single-page web application that serves as an easing function simulator, featuring functions like Linear, Ease-out, Ease-in, and more, based on available JSON data. The page layout includes a header, main area, and footer, and must be responsive for both desktop and mobile screens. The main area consists of three parts: options for easing functions, a simulation chart, and a slider. Users can select easing functions, which are reflected in real-time on the chart. The application must accommodate randomized elements such as the target audience, JSON data, and the behavior of the "About" panel, which will vary depending on the screen size and the day of the competition.
